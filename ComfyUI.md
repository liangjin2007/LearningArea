1. 使用pygit2获取代码版本号
        import pygit2
        repo = pygit2.Repository(repo_path)
        comfyui_version = repo.describe(describe_strategy=pygit2.GIT_DESCRIBE_TAGS)
        version = comfyui_version.strip()


2. 服务器相关
import aiohttp
from aiohttp import web

web.Request

2.1.
@web.middleware
async def cache_control(request: web.Request, handler):
    response: web.Response = await handler(request)


3.async io
import asyncio
async def send_socket_catch_exception(function, message):
  await asyncio.sleep(1)
asyncio.run(hello_world())



```


## asyncio
In Python, `async def` is used to define an asynchronous function, which is a feature introduced in Python 3.5 as part of PEP 492. Asynchronous functions are designed to allow cooperative multitasking, making it possible to handle I/O-bound tasks in a more efficient way.
Here's a simple example of an asynchronous function:
```python
import asyncio
async def hello_world():
    print("Hello")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an I/O-bound operation
    print("World")
# To run the above function, you need to use an event loop:
asyncio.run(hello_world())
```
### Key Points:
1. **async def**: This keyword is used to define an asynchronous function.
  
2. **await**: This keyword is used inside an `async` function to pause the function's execution until the awaited task is completed. This allows the event loop to switch to another task.
3. **Event Loop**: An asynchronous program in Python typically runs inside an event loop, which is responsible for executing tasks and switching between them.
4. **Cooperative Multitasking**: Asynchronous functions should explicitly yield control back to the event loop using `await`. This is different from pre-emptive multitasking where the operating system can interrupt a task at any time.
5. **Use Cases**: Asynchronous programming is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks like network requests, file operations, etc., where the program spends most of its time waiting for an operation to complete.
6. **Performance**: For CPU-bound tasks, asynchronous programming may not offer much performance benefit and could even introduce overhead.
By using `async def`, you can write more scalable and responsive applications, especially when dealing with a large number of concurrent I/O-bound operations.

## aiohttp
- middleware
在 aiohttp 中，middleware（中间件）是一个非常重要的概念，它指的是在请求到达最终的处理函数之前或发送响应到客户端之后，能够修改请求或响应的一些代码。中间件可以用于多种目的，比如日志记录、身份验证、请求解析、响应修改等。
中间件在 aiohttp 应用中是按照定义的顺序执行的，每个中间件都有机会处理请求和/或响应。它们可以执行以下操作：
在请求到达视图函数之前预处理请求。
在视图函数处理请求后，但在发送响应给客户端之前，修改响应。
访问和修改请求和响应对象。
终止请求-响应循环，例如，如果用户没有权限，可以返回错误或重定向。
在 aiohttp 中，中间件通常通过编写一个处理器（handler）来创建，这个处理器需要实现 handle 方法。下面是一个简单的中间件示例：
```
from aiohttp import web
class MyMiddleware:
    async def __call__(self, request, handler):
        # 请求预处理
        print("Before handler")
        # 调用后续的处理链（例如其他中间件或最终的处理函数）
        response = await handler(request)
        # 响应后处理
        print("After handler")
        # 返回响应
        return response
# 创建中间件实例
middleware = MyMiddleware()
# 创建应用和路由
app = web.Application(middlewares=[middleware])
```
在 aiohttp v3.0 之后，中间件可以使用 @web.middleware 装饰器来创建，如下所示：
```
from aiohttp import web
@web.middleware
async def my_middleware(request, handler):
    print("Before handler")
    response = await handler(request)
    print("After handler")
    return response
app = web.Application(middlewares=[my_middleware])
```
中间件是处理请求和响应的强大工具，它们可以帮助开发者编写可重用和模块化的代码，从而提高应用的可维护性。

## Web control
In the context of web request headers, the term "control" usually refers to the ability to specify certain conditions or preferences that govern how the request should be handled by the server or client. These controls are communicated through HTTP headers that are part of the request message sent by a client (such as a web browser) to a server.
Here are a few examples of how "control" might be interpreted in different HTTP request headers:
Caching Controls: Headers like Cache-Control are used to specify directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses. For example, you might use Cache-Control: no-cache to indicate that the response should not be served from a cache.
Cache-Control: max-age=3600, public
This header tells the server and any intermediate caches that the client is willing to accept a cached response that is no older than one hour (max-age=3600) and that the response can be stored in any cache (public).
Content Controls: The Accept and Accept-Language headers control what content types and languages the client is willing to accept, respectively.
Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml
Accept-Language: en-US, en;q=0.5
These headers inform the server about the client's preferences, allowing the server to tailor the response accordingly.
Conditional Requests: Headers like If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match give the client control over the request by allowing it to ask the server to send the requested resource only if it has been modified more recently than a certain date or if the entity tag does not match the one provided.
If-Modified-Since: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT
This header gives the client control over receiving updates only when the content has actually changed.
Authentication and Authorization Controls: Headers such as Authorization are used to provide credentials or tokens that give the client control over accessing resources that require authentication or specific authorization.
Authorization: Bearer [token]
This header provides the necessary information for the server to authenticate and authorize the request.
In summary, "control" in the context of web request headers refers to the ability to influence how a request is processed, what responses are acceptable, and under what conditions certain actions should be taken by the server.
