Multi-Trip Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows

Multi-Trip: Unlike the standard VRP where each vehicle is typically assumed to make a single trip during the planning horizon, in MTCVRPTW, vehicles can make multiple trips to serve customers as long as all constraints are respected. This acknowledges the real-world scenario where vehicles return to the depot to reload and then continue to make deliveries.
