## deformation

- A deformation can be represented by φ(x) : x -> x,     R3 to R3.

- F: deformation gradient -- The derivative is d φ(x) / dx, this is a higher level tensor F.
```
∂φ(x¯)/∂x¯
=∂(Fx¯ + t)/∂x¯
= F.
```

- Score function out of F Ψ(F) = psi(F) : when F = I it should be zero.
  - Frobenius norm || ||F, also known as Dirichlet energy.
  - ΨNeo-Hookean
