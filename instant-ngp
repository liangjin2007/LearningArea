### Diffuse interreflections : 说的是反射折射引起的简介光照
```
Diffuse interreflections occur when light is reflected and scattered by surfaces in a scene, resulting in indirect lighting. 
This occurs when light from a light source bounces off a surface and illuminates other surfaces in the scene. 
The light that is scattered in various directions by the illuminated surfaces then further reflects off other surfaces, creating a chain reaction of indirect lighting.

Diffuse interreflections are an important factor to consider in computer graphics and computer vision, as they play a significant role in determining the overall appearance of a scene. 
Accurately modeling diffuse interreflections can help create more realistic and physically accurate renderings of scenes.

### Albedo modulation : 指调节surface亮度
```
Albedo modulation refers to the process of modifying the reflectivity or albedo of a surface to achieve a desired effect. 
Albedo is a measure of the fraction of incoming light that a surface reflects, with a value of 1 indicating perfect reflection and a value of 0 indicating complete absorption.

In computer graphics and computer vision, albedo modulation is often used to adjust the appearance of surfaces in a scene.
For example, by increasing the albedo of a surface, the surface will reflect more light and appear brighter, while decreasing the albedo will result in a darker surface. 
This can be used to create different lighting effects, simulate the appearance of different materials, or enhance the contrast in an image.

Albedo modulation can be achieved through various techniques, such as adjusting the surface material properties, applying post-processing effects, or using image-based lighting. 
In addition, machine learning algorithms can be used to automatically adjust the albedo of surfaces based on the desired output.
