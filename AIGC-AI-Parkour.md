- google searching "mujoco based state of the art humanoid walk simulation github"
```
Several state-of-the-art MuJoCo-based humanoid walking simulations and related projects are available on GitHub, often utilizing reinforcement learning or model-predictive control techniques.
Key projects and resources include:
LocoMuJoCo: An imitation learning benchmark specifically designed for whole-body control, featuring diverse environments including humanoids and comprehensive datasets. This project is available on GitHub under the user robfiras.
unitreerobotics/unitree_mujoco: This repository provides MuJoCo simulations for Unitree robots, including functionalities for humanoid robots like an "elastic band" to assist in initial setup for walking.
HumanoidBench: A simulated humanoid benchmark for whole-body manipulation and locomotion tasks. While focused on manipulation, it includes 12 locomotion tasks and uses the MuJoCo physics engine with models like the Unitree H1.
Whole-Body Model-Predictive Control of Legged Robots with MuJoCo: This research demonstrates the use of iterative LQR (iLQR) with MuJoCo dynamics for whole-body MPC of legged robots, including humanoids, with code and videos available online. 
Humanoid-Gym: An easy-to-use reinforcement learning framework based on Nvidia Isaac Gym, designed to train locomotion skills for humanoid robots with an emphasis on zero-shot transfer from simulation to the real world. It also integrates a sim-to-sim framework to verify policies in MuJoCo. 
PPO-Humanoid (ProfessorNova/PPO-Humanoid): A PPO implementation for controlling a humanoid in Gymnasium's MuJoCo environment, offering customizable training scripts and parallel training. This can be found on GitHub under the user ProfessorNova. 
These projects and benchmarks provide valuable resources for developing and evaluating state-of-the-art humanoid walking simulations in MuJoCo, often leveraging advanced control techniques and reinforcement learning.
